# SynacorChallenge

Read  [arch-spec](arch-spec) for more info

See [lib/src/synacor](lib/src/synacor) for the virtual machine implementation

To run the sample build the project and execute: ```app/SynacorApp --binary SynacorChallenge/tests/data/challenge.bin```

Tested with gcc 11. I expect older compiler versions should be fine too
